## 1 | Problem

Cities like Bengaluru spew out torrents of information every minute, yet the data is *fragmented, noisy and late* ‚Äî tweets, news flashes and citizen reports pile up faster than officials can react, leading to poor situational awareness and slow response.

---

## 2 | Solution

City Pulse unifies those scattered signals into a single, living dashboard:

* Ingests real-time feeds from social, IoT sensors and user uploads.  
* Uses AI agents to clean, deduplicate and correlate events while learning from feedback.  
* Visualises the city‚Äôs ‚Äúpulse‚Äù on an interactive map and pushes predictive, personalised alerts to every stakeholder ‚Äî commuters, planners, first-responders.
